# XliffTranslate
XliffTranslate is an xliff based translation editor.

## Installation
No need to install just run it. Currently the exe is not signed so you might experience warning message the first time you run it.

## Limitations
Currently it can only replace translations in an existing file.
Translation state only has three options currently and they can't be changed on the UI.
