# XliffTranslate
XliffTranslate is an xliff based translation editor.

## Installation
No need to install just run it. Currently the exe is not signed so you might experience warning message the first time you run it.

## Usage
### Closing the app
The app can be closed with the close button on the top right.

### Loading translation file
Click load button on the top left and select the file containing the translations (file must have xlf extension).

Once the file is fully loaded a check mark should appear next to the load button, from here on out the navigation and translation editing options are usable.

### Selecting translation
Translations can be selected from the dropdown button right of the arrow buttons. It's also possible to go to the next or previous translation with the arrow buttons.

### Filtering translations
Filtering based on text is done through the textbox next to the check mark. Once the search phrase is entered press enter while the text box is selected to filter results.

### Editing translation
Currently only the target and state can be changed. State only has three options currently and this can't be changed without coding.

Once translation is changed the save button stores the change request (this does not modify any files yet). Saving on the same translation overwrites the last change request.

### Saving modified translation
Saving to file is done with the save translation button on the top row. Once pressed choose the file where the modifications should be done.

**Saving to a file that doesn't have the modified translation keys will not do anything.**
